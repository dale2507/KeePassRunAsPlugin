# KeePass Impersonation Plugin #

The KeePass Impersonation Plugin (aka KeePass RunAs Plugin) was developed to help in running applications as a user who's credentials are stored in your KeePass Password Safe.

The main use cases for this are:

* network admins who may need to run some applications as privileged users or,
* VPN users who's local account details are different from those they need to use to connect. [More Details...](.\UseCases\VPN.md)

There is only one configuration option for the plugin at the moment which is to have one password entry per application. You can learn about this on the [Setup Instructions Page](.\Setup\EntryPerApplication.md).
